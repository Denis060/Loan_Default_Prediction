## 📝 Project Description:
This project aims to help lending institutions identify high-risk borrowers by predicting the likelihood of loan default using historical data. The project follows a full data science pipeline including data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and presentation.

We use **Logistic Regression** to classify borrowers as likely to default (1) or repay (0) based on their financial and personal attributes.

## 🧪 Technical Overview

- **Model**: Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
- **Target Variable**: `Current_loan_status` → recoded to `loan_default` (0 = no default, 1 = default)
- **Features Used**:
  - Loan amount, interest rate, income, loan intent, credit history, employment duration, home ownership, and loan grade (encoded)
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy: 79%
  - Precision (Default class): 68%
  - Recall (Default class): 4%
  - Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, Classification Report

---

## 📊 Key Business Insights

- **High income** and **long credit history** reduce default risk
- **Loan grades D & E**, **high loan amounts**, and **medical debt** are associated with higher default
- Business can use these findings to make smarter approval and pricing decisions
